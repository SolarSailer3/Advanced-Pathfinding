## Contents
README â€“ readme file for DSA Assignment
GraphClasses.py - classes for the Nodes and Graph Data Structure aggregating from the Linked List Data Structure
LinkedListClasses.py - classes for Nodes and Linked List Data Structure, used to store a list of vertices in the graph and edges in a vertex
StackQueueClasses.py - classes for the Stack and Queue Data Structure aggregating from the Linked List Data Structure
UnitTestGraph.py - Test Harness for Graph class (format based on UnitTestLinkedList which was a provided Unit Test from Prac04)
UnitTestLinkedList.py - Test Harness for Linked List class (reused and extended the provided Unit Test from Prac04)
keyMeUp.py - User Interface to interact with the Virtual Keyboard simulation
edged.al - ABCD layout keyboard input file (Edged Keyboard)
wrap.al - Same as above but has the ability to wrap around edges

## Version information
<08/10/2022> - Initial version of the assignment. Reusing and reworking class script from previous practicals: Graph and Linked List
               Added methods in DSAGraph: deleteVertex, deleteEdge and DSAGraphNode: removeEdge
               building main script keyMeUp.py: main menu
               
<09/10/2022> - building BreadthFirstSearch algorithm for determining shortest path
               
<10/10/2022> - coding DepthFirstSearch algorithm for determining a path of any given length
               implemented options to save keyboard layout and pathways (and function to clean pathway)
               implemented options to clean and convert input string 

<11/10/2022> - Implemented a command line argument to be accepted to use the script in silent mode
